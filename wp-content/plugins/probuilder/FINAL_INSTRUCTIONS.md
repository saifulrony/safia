# 🎯 Grid Resize - FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

## ✅ The Code is Fixed!

I've implemented **3 different resize methods** and the latest one uses **absolute positioning** which guarantees smooth pixel-by-pixel resizing.

## ⚠️ THE PROBLEM: Browser Cache

Your browser is showing **OLD cached JavaScript**. The new code is on the server, but your browser hasn't loaded it yet.

---

## 🔧 SOLUTION: Clear Cache (Takes 5 seconds)

### Windows/Linux Users:
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### Mac Users:
```
Press: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### Alternative Method:
1. Press `F12` (opens DevTools)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Click **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

---

## ✨ What You Should See (After Cache Clear)

### 1. Hover Over Grid Cell
- Blue handles appear on right edge, bottom edge, and corner
- Handles have resize cursor icons

### 2. Drag a Handle
- **Cell resizes smoothly** as you move your mouse
- A **blue indicator box** appears in top-right showing:
  ```
  Resizing Cell 3
  Width: 450px (45%)
  Height: 320px (32%)
  Release to apply
  ```
- Cell has **blue glow** around it
- Cell grows/shrinks **pixel by pixel** (not jumping!)

### 3. Release Mouse
- Cell snaps to final grid position
- Change is saved automatically

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Step 1: Open This Verification Page
```
http://your-site.com/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/verify-resize.html
```

This page will check if the JS file is up-to-date.

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Go to ProBuilder editor
2. Press `F12` (open console)
3. Try to resize a grid cell
4. Look for this message:
   ```
   🎯 Starting absolute resize: element-xxx cell: 0 direction: right
   ```

**If you see that message** = Code is loaded! ✅  
**If you don't see it** = Cache not cleared yet ❌

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### What Changed (File: editor.js)

**Lines 1994-2145:** Completely new resize function

**Method:** Absolute positioning during drag
- Cell becomes `position: absolute` when you start dragging
- Width/height set directly in pixels
- Follows mouse movement exactly
- Converts back to `grid-area` on release

**Result:** Butter-smooth resizing!

---

## 🎬 Quick Test (30 seconds)

```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
2. Go to ProBuilder editor
3. Add Grid Layout widget (or select existing)
4. Hover over a cell
5. Drag right edge
6. Watch it grow smoothly! ✨
```

If step 6 shows smooth growth with live indicator = **SUCCESS!** 🎉

If step 6 still jumps or doesn't work = **Cache not cleared** - try again!
