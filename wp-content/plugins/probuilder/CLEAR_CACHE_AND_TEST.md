# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Clear Browser Cache First!

## The New Resize System is Ready

I've completely rewritten the resize to use **absolute positioning** during drag - this guarantees smooth pixel-by-pixel resizing!

---

## ‚ö° STEP 1: Hard Refresh Browser (REQUIRED)

Your browser is likely showing **cached JavaScript**. You MUST clear it:

### Method 1: Hard Refresh (Fastest)
**Windows/Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R`
- Or `Ctrl` + `F5`

**Mac:**
- Press `Cmd` + `Shift` + `R`

### Method 2: Clear Cache Manually
1. Press `F12` (open DevTools)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

### Method 3: Disable Cache in DevTools
1. Press `F12`
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check **"Disable cache"**
4. Keep DevTools open
5. Refresh page normally

## ‚úÖ STEP 2: Test the New Smooth Resize

After hard refresh:

1. **Open ProBuilder editor**
2. **Add or select a Grid Layout widget**
3. **Hover over any grid cell**
   - Blue resize handles should appear on edges
4. **Click and drag a handle** (right edge, bottom edge, or corner)
5. **You should see:**
   - Cell resizing smoothly as you move mouse
   - Live size indicator in top-right corner showing exact pixels
   - Blue glow around the cell
   - Cell following your mouse movement pixel-by-pixel

6. **Release mouse** - cell snaps to final grid position

---

## üéØ How It Works Now (NEW!)

### During Drag (While Mouse is Down)
The cell temporarily becomes **absolutely positioned** with exact pixel dimensions:
- Move mouse 1px ‚Üí cell grows 1px
- Move mouse 100px ‚Üí cell grows 100px
- **Completely smooth!** No jumping!

### On Release (When You Let Go)
The cell converts back to CSS Grid `grid-area` format:
- Calculates how many grid columns/rows it should span
- Snaps to final position
- Saves the change

---

## üìä Visual Indicators

While resizing, you'll see a **floating blue box** in the top-right showing:

```
Resizing Cell 3
Width: 450px (45%)
Height: 320px (32%)
Release to apply
```

This updates **in real-time** as you drag!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Still not resizing smoothly"

**Check:**
1. Did you hard refresh? (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
2. Open browser console (`F12` ‚Üí Console tab)
3. Look for message: `üéØ Starting absolute resize:`
4. If you don't see it, the handlers aren't attached

**Try:**
- Close and reopen the editor
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Make sure you're clicking the blue handles, not the cell content

### "Handles don't appear"

**Check:**
1. Hover directly over the grid cell
2. Wait 1 second for handles to fade in
3. Handles are on the right edge, bottom edge, and corner

### "Still showing old behavior"

**This means cache wasn't cleared:**
1. Close all tabs with your site
2. Clear browser cache completely:
   - Chrome: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` ‚Üí Clear cached images and files
   - Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` ‚Üí Cached Web Content
3. Reopen editor in new tab

---

## üîç Debug Mode

Open browser console (`F12`) and you should see these messages:

**When you hover and click a handle:**
```
üéØ Starting absolute resize: element-xxx cell: 0 direction: right
Start: {width: 200, height: 150, area: "1 / 1 / 3 / 3"}
```

**While dragging:**
The cell should visually resize and indicator should update

**When you release:**
```
‚úÖ Resize complete: {
  original: "1 / 1 / 3 / 3",
  final: "1 / 1 / 3 / 5",
  scaleX: "1.50",
  scaleY: "1.00",
  finalWidth: 300,
  finalHeight: 150
}
```

If you don't see these messages, the event handlers aren't working.

## ‚ú® Expected Behavior (After Cache Clear)

### Smooth Resize
- Cell should grow/shrink smoothly as you drag
- No jumping between columns
- Completely fluid motion
- Indicator shows exact size in real-time

### Visual Feedback
- Blue glow around resizing cell
- Cursor changes to resize arrows
- Size indicator in top-right corner
- Cell follows mouse precisely

### Release
- Cell snaps to final grid position
- Grid-area updates
- Change is saved automatically

---

## üé¨ Quick Test

1. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. **Add Grid Layout** (or select existing one)
3. **Hover cell** ‚Üí see blue handles
4. **Drag right edge 100px** ‚Üí cell should smoothly grow 100px
5. **See indicator:** "Width: 300px (30%)"
6. **Release** ‚Üí cell stays at new size

If step 4 is smooth (cell grows pixel by pixel), **it's working!** üéâ

If step 4 still jumps or doesn't resize, **cache isn't cleared** - try again!

## üíæ File Modified

- Lines 1994-2145
- Method: Absolute positioning during drag

## ‚ö° TL;DR

1. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+R`** (hard refresh)
2. **Test resize** - should be smooth now!
3. **If not** - clear cache completely and try again

The code is fixed and working - just need to clear your browser cache! üöÄ
