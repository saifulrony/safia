# 🔍 Debug: Why Are My Pages Showing Wrong Content?

## Your Situation

- **rony3:** Showing demo content (wrong)
- **rony4:** Showing demo content (wrong)
- **Expected:** Should show only "This is a heading"

---

## 🚨 Step-by-Step Diagnosis (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Visit rony4 and Look at the Debug Panel

**Visit:** `http://192.168.10.203:7000/rony4/`

**You should see TWO debug displays (while logged in):**

#### A) Top Debug Banner (dark background)
Shows:
```
🔍 ProBuilder Debug (Admin Only)
Post ID: xxx
Post Title: xxx
Post Slug: rony4
Elements: X  ← CHECK THIS NUMBER!
[Show Element Details] ← Click this!
```

**CRITICAL:** Check these:
- **Elements count:** Should be **1** (not 10+)
- Click "Show Element Details" → Should show: "Element 1: heading - 'This is a heading'"

#### B) Bottom Right Floating Panel
Shows quick info and edit button.

### Step 2: Open Browser Console While Saving

1. **Open rony4 in ProBuilder editor**
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Console
3. **Delete all elements** in the canvas (if there are many)
4. **Add ONE heading widget**
5. **Change text to:** "This is a heading"
6. **Click Save**
7. **Watch the console** - it will show:

```
=== SAVING PAGE ===
Post ID: [number]
Elements count: 1  ← Should be 1!
Elements array: [Object]
First element: {widgetType: "heading", ...}
Heading text: "This is a heading"
```

**If "Elements count" is NOT 1:** Something else is being saved!

---

### Step 3: Use the Diagnostic Tool

**Visit:**
```
http://192.168.10.203:7000/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/check-page-data.php?slug=rony4
```

**This shows EXACTLY what's in the database.**

**Look for:**
```
Element Count: 1
Element 1: heading - "This is a heading"
```

**If you see many elements:** Wrong data is in database!

---

## 🎯 What's Probably Happening

### Scenario A: Wrong Data Was Saved

**Problem:** When you saved, demo data was in the editor instead of just your heading.

**How to verify:**
- Open rony4 in ProBuilder editor
- Look at the canvas
- Do you see many elements or just one heading?

**If many elements:**
1. Delete everything
2. Add fresh heading
3. Save again
4. Check console shows "Elements count: 1"

### Scenario B: Cache Is Showing Old Data

**Problem:** Correct data saved but cache shows old content.

**How to verify:**
- Check diagnostic tool
- If shows "1 element" and "heading"
- But page shows demo content
- = Cache issue!
