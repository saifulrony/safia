## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem 1: Button doesn't appear**

**Check:**
```javascript
// In console
$('.grid-cell-delete-btn').length
// Should return number > 0
```

**Solution:**
- Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check if VERSION 5.0.0 message appears
- Try incognito mode

### **Problem 2: Button doesn't work when clicked**

**Check console for:**
```
🗑️ VERSION 5.0.0 - Delete grid cell clicked: X
```

**If you see message:**
- Confirmation dialog should appear
- Click OK to confirm

**If no message:**
- Event handler not attached
- Clear cache and retry

### **Problem 3: No confirmation dialog**

**This is intentional for widget delete** (instant delete)  
**Cell delete ALWAYS shows confirmation**

**If confirmation doesn't appear:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Check if `confirm()` is blocked by browser

## 💡 **USE CASES**

### **When to Use Cell Delete:**
- Remove a widget and clear the cell
- Reset a cell to empty state
- Quick cleanup of grid cells

- Just remove the widget quickly
