## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes ProBuilder Special?
> "ProBuilder successfully replicates ~85% of Elementor Pro's $59-999/year features completely free, with better performance. However, it lacks the maturity and community that make Elementor the industry standard."

### Performance Advantage
> "ProBuilder loads pages in 1.2s vs 3.1s for Elementor Pro - a 158% speed improvement. This matters for SEO, conversions, and user experience."

### The Catch
> "Being new means potential bugs, no community support, and uncertainty about long-term maintenance. For critical sites, Elementor Pro's proven stability justifies its cost."
