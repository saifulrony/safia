## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Widgets Still Not Showing?

**Check 1**: Widget count in admin
```
Admin → ProBuilder → Should show "109 widgets loaded"
```

**Check 2**: View debug log
```bash
tail -50 wp-content/debug.log | grep ProBuilder
```
Should show: "ProBuilder: Loaded 109 widget files"

**Check 3**: Clear cache
```bash
# In WordPress admin:
Settings → Clear all caches
# Or delete cache files:
rm -rf wp-content/cache/*
```

### Grid Resize Not Working?

1. Make sure "Enable Resize" is ON in widget settings
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
