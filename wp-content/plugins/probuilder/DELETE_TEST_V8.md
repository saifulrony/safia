# 🔧 DELETE BUTTON - VERSION 8.0.0

## ✅ **NEW APPROACH**

I've changed the approach to **completely remove and re-render** the grid element after deletion. This ensures a clean state.

## 📊 **WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN**

### **Before Delete:**
```
Cell 0: [Heading Widget]
Cell 1: [Text Widget]     ← Delete this
Cell 2: [Button Widget]
Cell 3: [Empty]
```

### **After Delete:**
```
Cell 0: [Heading Widget]   ← Still here
Cell 1: [Empty]            ← Now empty (Drop widgets here)
Cell 2: [Button Widget]    ← Still here
Cell 3: [Empty]            ← Still empty
```

## 🐛 **IF STILL NOT WORKING**

### **Test 1: Check if buttons exist**
```javascript
// In console
$('.grid-cell-delete-btn').length
// Should return > 0

$('.probuilder-nested-delete').length  
// Should return > 0 if widgets exist
```

### **Test 2: Manual click test**
```javascript
// In console - trigger delete manually
$('.grid-cell-delete-btn').first().click()
// Should show confirmation dialog

$('.probuilder-nested-delete').first().click()
// Should delete widget
```

### **Test 3: Check children array**
```javascript
// In console - find grid element
var gridElements = ProBuilderEditor.elements.filter(e => e.widgetType === 'grid-layout');
console.log('Grid elements:', gridElements);
console.log('Children:', gridElements[0].children);
```

### **Test 4: Manual delete**
```javascript
// In console - manually delete
var gridElement = ProBuilderEditor.elements.find(e => e.widgetType === 'grid-layout');
console.log('Before:', gridElement.children);
gridElement.children[1] = null;
console.log('After:', gridElement.children);

// Then manually re-render
var $old = $('.probuilder-element[data-id="' + gridElement.id + '"]');
$old.remove();
ProBuilderEditor.renderElement(gridElement);
```
