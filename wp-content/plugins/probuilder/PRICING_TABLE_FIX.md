# Pricing Table Widget - Fixed & Enhanced

## Problem
The Pricing Table element in ProBuilder was showing as a simple "3 column container" instead of displaying the actual pricing table with all its elements (title, price, features, button, etc.).

## Root Cause
The pricing table widget (`pricing-table.php`) existed and was registered, but it was missing a preview template in the `editor.js` file. Without a preview template, the editor fell back to showing a generic widget placeholder.

## Solution

### 1. Added Preview Template in editor.js
Added a complete preview template for the `pricing-table` widget in `/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/assets/js/editor.js` (around line 2244).

The preview template now includes:
- **Title** - Plan name (e.g., "Basic Plan")
- **Price** - Currency symbol, amount, and period
- **Features List** - With checkmark icons for each feature
- **Button** - Call-to-action button with customizable text
- **Featured Badge** - "POPULAR" badge for featured plans
- **Professional Styling** - Border radius, hover effects, proper spacing

### 2. Enhanced Widget with Style Controls
Updated `/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/widgets/pricing-table.php` with:

**New Style Controls:**
- Border Color
- Title Color
- Price Color  
- Button Background Color
- Button Text Color
- Featured Color (applied when "Featured" is enabled)

**Improved Rendering:**
- Added checkmark icons (dashicons) to feature list items
- Better text alignment (features left-aligned, rest centered)
- Enhanced styling with border-radius and transitions
- Proper color inheritance from style settings
- Security improvements with proper escaping (esc_attr, esc_html, esc_url)

### 3. Content Controls (Already Existed)
- Title
- Currency
- Price
- Period
- Features (repeater field)
- Button Text
- Button Link
- Featured (switcher)

## How It Works Now

### In the Editor
When you drag the Pricing Table widget into the canvas, you'll see:
- A complete pricing table preview with all elements
- Title displayed prominently at the top
- Large price display with currency and period
- List of features with checkmark icons
- Call-to-action button at the bottom
- "POPULAR" badge if Featured is enabled

### Customization
1. **Content Tab** - Edit title, price, features, button text/link, and toggle featured status
2. **Style Tab** - Customize colors for borders, title, price, button, and featured elements

### Featured Plans
When you enable "Featured" toggle:
- Border color changes to the featured color (default: blue)
- Button background changes to the featured color
- "POPULAR" badge appears in the top-right corner
- Feature checkmarks use the featured color

## Usage Example

```php
// The widget renders like this on the frontend:
<div class="probuilder-pricing-table" style="...">
    <!-- Featured Badge (if enabled) -->
    <div class="probuilder-pricing-badge">POPULAR</div>
    
    <!-- Title -->
    <h3>Basic Plan</h3>
    
    <!-- Price -->
    <div class="probuilder-pricing-price">
        <span>$</span>
        <span>29</span>
        <div>per month</div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Features -->
    <ul class="probuilder-pricing-features">
        <li>✓ Feature 1</li>
        <li>✓ Feature 2</li>
        <li>✓ Feature 3</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Button -->
    <a href="#" class="probuilder-pricing-button">Get Started</a>
</div>
```

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Clear Browser Cache** - Important! The browser may have cached the old editor.js
2. **Open ProBuilder Editor** - Navigate to any page with ProBuilder
3. **Find Pricing Table Widget** - Look in the "Content" category
4. **Drag to Canvas** - You should now see a complete pricing table preview
5. **Edit Settings** - Try changing colors, features, and toggling "Featured"
6. **Add Multiple Tables** - Works great in a 3-column container for comparison layouts

## Benefits

✅ **Complete Preview** - See exactly how your pricing table looks while editing
✅ **Full Customization** - Control all colors through the Style tab
✅ **Professional Design** - Modern styling with icons, badges, and hover effects
✅ **Easy to Use** - Intuitive controls for all common pricing table elements
✅ **Flexible** - Works standalone or in multi-column layouts

## Files Modified

1. `/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/assets/js/editor.js` - Added pricing-table preview case
2. `/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/widgets/pricing-table.php` - Added style controls and enhanced rendering

## Browser Cache Note

**Important:** After this update, users should clear their browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) to see the changes in the editor, as the editor.js file was updated.
