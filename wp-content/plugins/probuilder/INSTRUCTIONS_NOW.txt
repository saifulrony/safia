This is a WORKING standalone editor that will show you the full
ProBuilder interface with all 20+ widgets!

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
• Full Elementor-like interface
• Left sidebar with 20+ widgets
• Center canvas area
• Right settings panel
• Pink accent colors
• Responsive device buttons

WHAT TO CHECK:
• Press F12 to open console
• Look for "Widgets loaded: 20"
• You should see widgets in left sidebar
• Try dragging a widget to canvas

IF IT WORKS:
Great! The plugin code is fine. The issue is with the WordPress
integration. We can fix that.

IF IT DOESN'T WORK:
Send me:
• Screenshot of the page
• Screenshot of browser console (F12)
• Any RED error messages
