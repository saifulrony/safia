# ProBuilder Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ WordPress Admin Bar Now Visible
**Problem:** The WordPress admin bar was hidden in the ProBuilder editor.

**Solution:**
- Removed `display: none !important` CSS rule that was hiding the admin bar
- Updated positioning to show both admin bar and ProBuilder header
- Admin bar: `top: 0` (z-index: 99999)
- ProBuilder header: `top: 32px` below admin bar (z-index: 99998)
- Main editor area: adjusted to `margin-top: 77px` (32px admin bar + 45px header)

**Files Changed:**
- `assets/css/editor.css`
- `templates/editor.php`

---

### 2. ✅ Block Operations Target Blocks, Not Contents
**Problem:** When trying to move, resize, or delete blocks, the operations were affecting the content inside instead of the block itself.

**Solution:**
- Added `pointer-events: none` to all content inside `.probuilder-element-preview`
- Set `pointer-events: auto !important` on control elements (drag handles, action buttons)
- Updated sortable to use `handle: '.probuilder-element-drag'` so blocks only move via the drag handle
- Changed cursor from `grab` to `grabbing` during drag operations

**CSS Rules Added:**
```css
/* Protect content from drag operations */
.probuilder-element-preview * {
    pointer-events: none;
    user-select: none;
}

/* Enable specific interactive elements */
.probuilder-element-controls *,
.probuilder-element-actions button {
    pointer-events: auto !important;
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `assets/css/editor.css`
- `assets/js/editor.js`

### 3. ✅ Grid Resize Handles Now Show on Left and Right
**Problem:** Grid resize handles (`.grid-resize-handle-right`, `.grid-resize-handle-left`) were not showing on the left and right sides of grid cells.

**Solution:**
- Added CSS rules to make grid resize handles always interactive with `pointer-events: auto !important`
- Added missing left resize handle to grid cells
- Implemented left-side resize logic (resize from left by dragging left/right)
- Updated CSS positioning for all handles:
  - **Left handle:** `left: -[gap/2]px` (4px wide, full height)
  - **Right handle:** `right: -[gap/2]px` (4px wide, full height)
  - **Bottom handle:** `bottom: -[gap/2]px` (full width, 4px tall)
  - **Corner handle:** `bottom-right` (12px × 12px)

**Resize Behavior:**
- **Left handle:** Dragging left increases width, dragging right decreases width
- **Right handle:** Dragging right increases width, dragging left decreases width
- **Bottom handle:** Dragging down increases height
- **Corner handle:** Diagonal resize (both width and height)

**CSS Rules Added:**
```css
/* Grid layout resize handles - ALWAYS interactive */
.grid-resize-handle,
.grid-resize-handle-right,
.grid-resize-handle-bottom,
.grid-resize-handle-corner,
.grid-resize-handle-left {
    pointer-events: auto !important;
    user-select: none !important;
    z-index: 100 !important;
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `assets/css/editor.css` - Added CSS rules
- `assets/js/editor.js` - Added left handle HTML, CSS styles, and resize logic

## Testing Instructions

### Test Admin Bar
1. Open ProBuilder editor
2. Verify WordPress admin bar is visible at the very top
3. Verify ProBuilder header is visible below the admin bar
4. Both bars should be fully functional

### Test Block Operations
1. Add a heading or text block to the canvas
2. **Move:** Hover over block → Use drag handle (⋮⋮ icon) to move the block
3. **Edit:** Click the "Edit" button in the control bar
4. **Delete:** Click the trash icon to delete the block
5. **Verify:** Content inside blocks should not interfere with these operations

### Test Grid Resize Handles
1. Add a Grid Layout widget to the canvas
2. Hover over any grid cell
3. **Verify handles appear:**
   - Blue vertical bar on the **left** edge
   - Blue vertical bar on the **right** edge
   - Blue horizontal bar on the **bottom** edge
   - Blue square dot on the **bottom-right** corner
4. **Test resizing:**
   - Drag left handle → resizes from left side
   - Drag right handle → resizes from right side
   - Drag bottom handle → resizes height
   - Drag corner → resizes both dimensions
5. Real-time size indicator appears during resize

## Browser Cache

After updating these files, **clear your browser cache** or do a hard refresh:
- **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Safari:** `Cmd + Option + R`

## Summary

All three issues have been fixed:
1. ✅ WordPress admin bar is now visible
2. ✅ Block operations (move/resize/delete) target blocks, not their contents
3. ✅ Grid resize handles show on all sides (left, right, bottom, corner) and work correctly

The ProBuilder editor now has better usability with proper separation between block-level and content-level interactions.
