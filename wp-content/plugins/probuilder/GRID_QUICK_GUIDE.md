## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: Widget won't drop into cell?**  
A: Make sure you're dragging from the sidebar widgets, not from the canvas.

**Q: Can't see resize handles?**  
A: Hover over the cell for 1 second - handles appear on hover.

**Q: Resize not working smoothly?**  
A: Drag slowly - handles have sensitivity to prevent accidents.

**Q: How to remove a widget from a cell?**  
A: Hover over the widget → Click the delete (trash) button.

**Q: Can I put multiple widgets in one cell?**  
A: Not yet - each cell holds one widget. Use a Container widget inside for multiple widgets.
