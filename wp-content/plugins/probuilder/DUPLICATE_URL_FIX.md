# 🚨 ProBuilder URL Issue Fixed: Different URLs Showing Same Page

## The Problem

When you publish pages with ProBuilder, different URLs show the same content. For example:
- `/page-1/` shows content A
- `/page-2/` also shows content A (should show content B)
- `/page-3/` also shows content A (should show content C)

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**The issue:** Multiple pages were using the **SAME URL SLUG** (permalink).

### How This Happens

WordPress uses the URL slug (e.g., `my-page` in `example.com/my-page/`) to find which page to display. If multiple pages have the same slug:

```
Page 1: ID 123, slug = "rony"
Page 2: ID 456, slug = "rony"  ← DUPLICATE!
Page 3: ID 789, slug = "rony"  ← DUPLICATE!
```

WordPress only shows **Page 1** for all three URLs because they all have the same slug!

### Why It Happened

1. **Page duplication** - Copying pages without changing the URL
2. **Manual slug editing** - Setting the same URL for different pages
3. **Import/migration issues** - Importing pages with duplicate slugs
4. **Auto-draft pages** - Multiple pages created with empty slugs

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Enhanced Duplicate Detection (Backend)

**File:** `includes/class-ajax.php`

**Changes:**
```php
// When saving page settings (title/URL)
- Detects if another page is already using the same slug
- Automatically makes the slug unique by adding numbers (e.g., page-2, page-3)
- Flushes WordPress rewrite rules
- Notifies user if slug was changed
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents new duplicate slugs
- ✅ Auto-fixes conflicts
- ✅ User gets notified
- ✅ URLs work immediately

### Fix 2: Slug Validation on Save

**File:** `includes/class-ajax.php` → `save_page()` function

**Changes:**
```php
// When saving page content
- Checks for duplicate slugs before publishing
- Generates unique slug from title if needed
- Creates fallback slug (page-{id}) if title is empty
- Flushes rewrite rules after save
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Every published page gets a unique URL
- ✅ No more conflicts
- ✅ Works even for auto-draft pages

### Fix 3: Diagnostic Tool

**File:** `diagnose-url-issue.php`

**Features:**
- 📊 Shows all ProBuilder pages and their slugs
- 🚨 Highlights duplicate slugs in red
- 🔧 One-click auto-fix for all duplicates
- ⚙️ Checks permalink settings
- 📋 Detailed page information

## 🚀 How to Fix Existing Issues

### Option 1: Use Diagnostic Tool (Recommended)

1. **Visit the diagnostic page:**
   ```
   http://your-site.com/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/diagnose-url-issue.php
   ```

2. **Check for duplicates:**
   - Red-highlighted rows = duplicate slugs
   - See which pages are affected

3. **Click "Auto-Fix All Duplicate Slugs":**
   - Automatically renames duplicate pages
   - Keeps first page with original slug
   - Adds numbers to others (page-2, page-3, etc.)
   - Updates WordPress rewrite rules

4. **Done!** All pages now have unique URLs.

### Option 2: Manual Fix

If you prefer to manually fix each page:

1. **Go to WordPress Admin → Pages**

2. **Find duplicate pages:**
   - Look for pages with similar names
   - Edit each one

3. **Change the permalink:**
   - Click "Edit" next to the permalink under the title
   - Change it to something unique
   - Click "OK"

4. **Save the page**

5. **Flush permalinks:**
   - Go to **Settings → Permalinks**
   - Click "Save Changes" (even if you changed nothing)

## 🎯 How to Prevent This in the Future

### ✅ Best Practices

1. **Use unique page names**
   - Each page should have a different title
   - ProBuilder will generate unique slugs automatically

2. **Check URL before publishing**
   - Look at the permalink when editing
   - Make sure it's unique

3. **Don't duplicate pages manually**
   - If you need to copy a page, immediately rename it
   - Change both title and URL slug

4. **Use the diagnostic tool periodically**
   - Run it monthly to check for issues
   - Fix any duplicates immediately

### ✅ Automatic Prevention (Now Active)

The fixes we applied will **automatically prevent** duplicate slugs:

- ✨ When you save a page, ProBuilder checks for duplicates
- ✨ If duplicate found, automatically makes it unique
- ✨ You get notified if the URL was changed
- ✨ No manual intervention needed!

## 📊 Quick Diagnostic Commands

### Check if you have duplicate slugs:

```sql
-- Run this in phpMyAdmin or wp-cli
SELECT post_name, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM wp_posts 
WHERE post_type = 'page' 
AND post_status = 'publish' 
GROUP BY post_name 
HAVING count > 1;
```

### List all ProBuilder pages:

```sql
SELECT p.ID, p.post_title, p.post_name, p.post_status
FROM wp_posts p
INNER JOIN wp_postmeta pm ON p.ID = pm.post_id
WHERE pm.meta_key = '_probuilder_data'
AND p.post_status = 'publish'
ORDER BY p.ID DESC;
```

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Symptom: URLs still showing wrong content

**Try these steps:**

1. **Clear WordPress cache:**
   ```
   http://your-site.com/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/clear-cache.php
   ```

2. **Flush rewrite rules:**
   - Go to **Settings → Permalinks**
   - Click "Save Changes"

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac)
   - Clear cached images and files
   - Or use incognito/private browsing mode

4. **Check page exists:**
   - Visit: `http://your-site.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page`
   - Make sure the page is published (not draft)

5. **Run diagnostic again:**
   - Use the diagnostic tool to verify no duplicates remain

### Symptom: Page shows 404 error

This means the page doesn't exist or URL is wrong:

1. **Check page status:**
   - Is it published? (not draft, pending, or trash)
   
2. **Check the actual URL:**
   - Go to WordPress Admin → Pages
   - Find your page and click "View"
   - This shows the real URL

3. **Flush permalinks:**
   - Settings → Permalinks → Save Changes

## 📝 Technical Details

### How WordPress Resolves URLs

1. User visits `/my-page/`
2. WordPress queries database: `SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_name = 'my-page'`
3. If multiple results → WordPress picks the **first one** (usually oldest)
4. All other pages with same slug become "hidden"

### Why Flush Rewrite Rules?

WordPress caches URL patterns for performance. When you:
- Change a slug
- Publish a new page
- Update permalink structure

You must flush rewrite rules so WordPress rebuilds its URL cache.

### The Fix Logic

```php
// Pseudo-code
function save_page($post_id, $slug) {
    // Check if slug is already used
    $existing = get_page_by_path($slug);
    
    if ($existing && $existing->ID != $post_id) {
        // Duplicate! Make it unique
        $slug = wp_unique_post_slug($slug, ...);
        // Result: "page" becomes "page-2"
    }
    
    // Save with unique slug
    update_post($post_id, ['post_name' => $slug]);
    
    // Make WordPress recognize new URL immediately
    flush_rewrite_rules();
}
```
