3. **Widget disappears** instantly!

### **Visual Cues:**

- **Blue dashed outline** = Valid drop target

- **Grab cursor** = Widget can be dragged
- **Grabbing cursor** = Currently dragging
- **Widget lifts up** = Hover effect
- **Rotated clone** = Drag preview

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Move Functionality:**
```javascript
// Drag detection
mousedown.nestedDrag → Create visual clone
mousemove.nestedDrag → Update clone position + highlight targets
mouseup.nestedDrag → Move widget data + re-render grid
```

### **Delete Functionality:**
```javascript
// Click delete button
click → Remove from children array → Re-render grid → Save history
```

### **Visual Feedback:**
```css
.probuilder-drop-target { outline: 2px dashed #007cba; }
.probuilder-drop-hover { outline: 3px solid #007cba; transform: scale(1.02); }
.probuilder-nested-element:hover { transform: translateY(-2px); }
```
