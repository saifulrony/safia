# Minimum Height & Delete Button Fix

## Issues Fixed ✅

### Issue 1: Can't Resize Below 150px Height
**Problem:** Grid cells couldn't be resized below 150px height, even though the code allowed it.

### Issue 2: Can't Delete Blocks Inside Grid
**Problem:** Delete buttons weren't visible, so blocks inside grid cells couldn't be deleted.

## Root Causes

### 1. Min-Height CSS Override
The grid cell had `min-height: ${gridMinHeight}px` in the inline CSS, which was defaulting to 150px. Even when you set an explicit height like 50px, the CSS `min-height: 150px` would override it.

```css
/* CSS rule: */
min-height: 150px;

/* Your resize attempt: */
height: 50px;

/* Browser applies: */
height: 150px; /* min-height wins! */
```

### 2. Toolbar Not Showing on Hover
The delete/edit toolbar was set to `display: none` but there was no CSS rule to show it on hover, so users couldn't see or click the delete button.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Min-Height Restrictions

**Changed in 3 locations:**

#### A. Default min-height (Line 4122):
```javascript
// Before:
const gridMinHeight = settings.min_height || 150;

// After:
const gridMinHeight = settings.min_height || 30;
```

#### B. Removed inline CSS min-height (Line 4160):
```javascript
// Before:
#${gridId} .grid-cell {
    min-height: ${gridMinHeight}px; // Applied 150px or 30px
    /* ... */
}

// After:
#${gridId} .grid-cell {
    min-height: 0 !important; // Removed restriction completely
    /* ... */
}
```

#### C. Reduced resize minimums (Multiple lines):
```javascript
// Before:
Math.max(50, startWidth + deltaX)  // Couldn't go below 50px

// After:
Math.max(20, startWidth + deltaX)  // Can go down to 20px
```

**All locations updated:**
- Grid cell resize during drag: Lines 2237, 2248, 2257, 2268
- Widget resize during drag: Lines 2616, 2618, 2622, 2624
- Widget resize on release: Lines 2660, 2662, 2666, 2668
- Nested widget resize: Lines 3497-3528 (all switch cases)

### 2. Made Toolbar Visible on Hover (Lines 4403-4406)

**Added CSS rule:**
```css
#${gridId} .probuilder-resizable-widget:hover .probuilder-nested-toolbar,
#${gridId} .probuilder-nested-element:hover .probuilder-nested-toolbar {
    display: flex !important;
}
```

**How it works:**
- Hover over widget in grid cell → Toolbar appears
- Toolbar shows Edit and Delete buttons
- Click delete → Widget removed

### 3. Ensured Buttons Are Clickable (Lines 4533, 4548)

**Added pointer-events:**
```javascript
// Toolbar container:
pointer-events: auto;

// Buttons:
pointer-events: auto;

// Icons inside buttons:
pointer-events: none; // Click passes through to button
```
