# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFINITIVE CACHE CLEARING GUIDE

## üéØ The Situation

**The code IS updated on the server** - I've verified this.  
**Your browser IS showing old cached code** - This is why you see "still same".

---

## üîç STEP 1: Verify the Code is on Server

Visit this page: **`http://your-site.com/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/test-code-version.html`**

This will show you:
- ‚úÖ If the new code is on the server (it is!)
- ‚ùå If your browser is caching (it is!)

---

## üö® STEP 2: NUCLEAR CACHE CLEAR (Do This!)

### Windows/Linux:

1. **Close ALL tabs** with your WordPress site
2. Press **`Ctrl + Shift + Delete`**
3. A window opens - select these options:
   - ‚úÖ **Cached images and files** (IMPORTANT!)
   - ‚úÖ **Cookies and site data** (optional but helps)
   - ‚ùå Don't select passwords/history unless you want to
4. Time range: **"All time"**
5. Click **"Clear data"** button
6. **Close browser completely** (not just the window - close Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
7. **Wait 10 seconds**
8. **Reopen browser**
9. Go to ProBuilder editor

### Mac:

1. **Close ALL tabs** with your WordPress site
2. Press **`Cmd + Shift + Delete`**
3. Select same options as above
4. Time range: **"All time"**
5. Click **"Clear data"**
6. **Quit browser completely** (Cmd + Q)
7. **Wait 10 seconds**
8. **Reopen browser**
9. Go to ProBuilder editor

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 3: Verify New Code is Loaded

After clearing cache above, open ProBuilder editor and:

1. Press **F12** to open console
2. Try to **drag a grid cell resize handle**
3. **Look for this EXACT message** in console:

```
üìå CODE VERSION: 3.0.0-responsive-2024-10-26 - WITH RESPONSIVE NEIGHBORS
```

### If You See This Message:
üéâ **SUCCESS!** The new code is loaded! 

The resize should now:
- ‚úÖ Not show widget modal on release
- ‚úÖ Maintain exact size (520px = 520px)
- ‚úÖ Shrink neighboring cells proportionally

### If You DON'T See This Message:
‚ùå **Cache still not cleared**

Try this extreme method:

#### Extreme Cache Clear (If Above Didn't Work):

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Open Chrome/Edge
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Go to **"Application"** tab
4. Click **"Clear site data"** on left
5. Click **"Clear site data"** button
6. Close ALL tabs
7. Type in URL bar: `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData`
8. Select "All time" and clear
9. Close browser completely
10. Reopen and test

**Firefox:**
1. Open Firefox
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Go to **"Storage"** tab
4. Right-click each item ‚Üí Delete all
5. Close ALL tabs
6. Type in URL bar: `about:preferences#privacy`
7. Click "Clear Data"
8. Close browser completely
9. Reopen and test

---

## üî¨ STEP 4: Detailed Testing

After cache is DEFINITELY cleared:

### Test 1: Check Console Message
```
Expected: üìå CODE VERSION: 3.0.0-responsive-2024-10-26
Result: [    ] Saw it / [    ] Didn't see it
```

### Test 2: Widget Modal
```
Action: Drag and release a grid cell resize handle
Expected: No widget modal appears
Result: [    ] No modal / [    ] Modal appeared
```

### Test 3: Exact Size
```
Action: Drag to exactly 520px (watch indicator)
Release: Cell should be 520px (not 570px)
Result: [    ] Exact size / [    ] Different size
```

### Test 4: Responsive Neighbors
```
Action: Drag one cell to make it bigger
Expected: Other cells get smaller
Result: [    ] Neighbors shrank / [    ] Neighbors stayed same
```

## üì± Alternative: Use Different Browser

If cache clearing isn't working:

1. **Download a fresh browser** you haven't used
   - Chrome Canary
   - Firefox Developer Edition
   - Edge Dev
   - Opera

2. **Open in Incognito/Private mode** (Ctrl+Shift+N)
   - This uses no cache
   - Definitive test

3. **Test in the new browser**
   - If it works there = cache issue in main browser
   - If it doesn't work = let me know!

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Alternative: Disable Cache in DevTools

This keeps cache disabled while DevTools is open:

1. Press **F12** (open DevTools)
2. Go to **"Network"** tab
3. Check the box: **"Disable cache"**
4. **Keep DevTools open** (important!)
5. Refresh page (F5)
6. Test resize

As long as DevTools stays open with "Disable cache" checked, you'll always get fresh code.

---

## üîß Alternative: Add Cache Buster to URL

Temporarily force new version:

1. Go to your editor
2. Add `?v=` + current timestamp to URL
3. Example: `https://your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=probuilder&v=1234567890`
4. This forces browser to reload fresh

---

## üìä What You Should See (After Cache Clear)

## üÜò If NOTHING Works

If after ALL of the above you still see "still same":

1. **Take a screenshot** of:
   - The browser console when you try to resize
   - The test-code-version.html page results

2. **Tell me**:
   - Which browser you're using (Chrome/Firefox/Edge?)
   - Browser version
   - What message you see (or don't see) in console

3. **Try this command** (on your server):
   ```bash
   ls -lh /home/saiful/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/assets/js/editor.js
   ```
   Send me the output - it will show file size and date
