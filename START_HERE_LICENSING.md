## ⚡ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update License Server URL (5 minutes)

**YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE DISTRIBUTING!**

Edit these 2 files and replace the placeholder URL with your actual domain:

#### File 1: Plugin License Manager
**Path:** `/home/saiful/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/probuilder/includes/class-license-manager.php`

**Line 21, change from:**
```php
private $license_server = 'https://yourdomain.com/license-api/';
```

**To:**
```php
private $license_server = 'https://YOUR-ACTUAL-DOMAIN.com/license-api/';
```

**Lines 26-27, update:**
```php
private $company_name = 'Your Company Name'; // Change if needed
private $company_website = 'https://YOUR-ACTUAL-DOMAIN.com';
```

#### File 2: Theme License Manager
**Path:** `/home/saiful/wordpress/wp-content/themes/ecocommerce-pro/inc/class-theme-license-manager.php`

**Make the same changes** (same line numbers)

---

### 2. Set Up License Server (30 minutes - 2 hours)

You need a server to handle license activation/validation.

**Option A: Easy Digital Downloads (Recommended - Easiest)**

3. Buy [Software Licensing Extension](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/software-licensing/) ($199/year)
4. Create products for your theme/plugin
5. Configure license generation
6. Done! Licenses will be automatically generated and managed

**Option B: Freemius (No Setup - They Handle Everything)**

2. Integrate their SDK into your products
3. They handle license server, payments, everything
4. Pay 30% commission on sales
5. No technical setup needed

**Option C: Custom Solution (Advanced)**

Build your own license API using Laravel, Node.js, or PHP.  
See `SAFIA_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` for implementation details.

### 3. Test Everything (15 minutes)

**Before distributing to customers!**

1. **Install on Clean WordPress**
   ```bash
   # Create test WordPress site
   # Install your theme/plugin
   # Verify license notice appears
   ```

2. **Test License Activation**
   - Go to ProBuilder → License (or Appearance → License)
   - Enter a test license key
   - Click "Activate License"
   - Should show success message

3. **Test Features**
