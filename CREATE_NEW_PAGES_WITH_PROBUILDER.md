# 📝 How to Create New Pages with ProBuilder

## You Said: "New pages are not created by ProBuilder"

Let me clarify the workflow! ProBuilder doesn't create pages - **WordPress creates pages**, and then you **edit them with ProBuilder**.

---

## ✅ **Correct Workflow for New Pages**

### Step 1: Create Page in WordPress
```
Go to: Pages → Add New
```

1. Enter a **page title** (e.g., "Contact Us", "About", "Services")
2. **Don't add any content** in the editor
3. Click **"Publish"** button
4. Page is now created!

### Step 2: Edit with ProBuilder
```
Go to: Pages → All Pages
```

1. Find your new page in the list
2. Hover over it
3. Click **"Edit with ProBuilder"** link (appears in red text)
4. ProBuilder editor will open

### Step 3: Build Your Content
1. Drag widgets from the left panel
2. Add heading, text, images, buttons, etc.
3. Customize styles
4. Click **💾 Save** button (top right)
5. Click **"🔗 View Page"** to see result

## 🔍 **Quick Diagnosis**

### Run this tool to check everything:
```

```

This will tell you:
- ✅ Is ProBuilder working?
- ✅ Is Elementor really uninstalled?
- ✅ Are pages enabled for ProBuilder?
- ✅ Can you create test pages?

---

## 🎯 **Common Misunderstandings**

### ❌ WRONG: "ProBuilder should create pages"
ProBuilder is a **page builder**, not a page creator. It builds/designs pages that already exist.

### ✅ CORRECT: "WordPress creates pages, ProBuilder designs them"
1. WordPress creates the page (Pages → Add New)
2. ProBuilder designs the page (Edit with ProBuilder)

Think of it like:
- WordPress = The house builder (creates the structure)
- ProBuilder = The interior designer (makes it beautiful)

---

## 🧪 **Test It Now**

### Create a Test Page:

1. **Go to:**
   ```
   http://192.168.10.203:7000/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=page
   ```

2. **Enter title:** "Test Page"

3. **Click "Publish"**

4. **Go to:**
   ```
   http://192.168.10.203:7000/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page
   ```

5. **Find "Test Page"** in the list

6. **Click "Edit with ProBuilder"** (red link below the title)

7. **Add a heading widget:**
   - Click "Heading" in left panel
   - Type some text
   - Click Save

8. **View the page:**
   - Click "View Page" button
   - You should see your heading!

## 🔍 **What If "Edit with ProBuilder" Link is Missing?**

Run the diagnostic tool:
```

```

It will check:
1. Is ProBuilder active?
2. Are pages enabled for ProBuilder?
3. Is there a configuration issue?

And provide a **one-click fix** if needed.

## 📊 **Your Current Situation**

Since you uninstalled Elementor:
- ✅ Old pages: Keep them (no need to remove)
- ✅ New pages: Create in WordPress, edit with ProBuilder
- ✅ ProBuilder should work on all new pages
